# xrp-huskylense
This repository provides support for using a HuskyLens with the XRP robot.
This is an unofficial project and is not maintained by the HuskyLens or XRP developers.

**Installation**

Place all files in this repository into your lib folder exactly as provided.

This implementation is configured to use QWIIC port 0 by default.
To use a different port, modify the value in qwiic_huskylens.py (line 118).

**Pin References**

**Contributions**

Feedback and improvements are welcome!
The current fix works but is still a bit rough around the edges, and I'd love to see cleaner or alternative solutions from the community.
